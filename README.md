# Optimization of Chromatography Resins for Monoclonal Antibody Purification

_OBSERVE: This is a mock project, data for analysis was randomly generated by AI_


This project aims to optimize the performance of chromatography resins used in the purification of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), which are critical components of many biopharmaceutical products. By leveraging  statistical analysis, we seek to identify the key factors influencing resin performance and develop predictive models to guide resin design and optimization efforts.

## Key Objectives:

Identify key factors influencing the binding capacity, selectivity, and purification efficiency of chromatography resins for mAb purification.
Design and conduct a series of experiments using a factorial design approach to systematically explore the effects of factors on resin performance.
Analyze experimental data using statistical techniques such as Ordinary Least Squares regression (OLS) to describe the relationship between resin properties and process conditions (independent quantitative variables) and resin performance indicatorsa (one at a time, dependent variable).
Develop predictive models to estimate resin performance based on resin properties and process conditions.
Optimize resin formulations and process parameters to maximize binding capacity, selectivity, and purification efficiency.

## Project Tasks:

**Scientists**

1. Literature Review:
Review existing literature on chromatography resin design and mAb purification processes to identify relevant factors and experimental approaches.

2. Experimental Design:
Design a factorial experiment to systematically vary factors such as ligand density, pore size, pH, and salt concentration.
Utilize statistical software (e.g., R or Python) to generate a randomized experimental plan.

3. Experimental Execution:
Synthesize chromatography resins with varying compositions and properties according to the experimental plan.
Perform chromatography experiments using model mAbs to evaluate resin performance under different conditions.

**Data Scientists**

4. Data Analysis:
__Analyze experimental data using statistical techniques such as OLS to identify significant factors.
Visualize experimental results using plots and graphs to illustrate trends and relationships.__

5. Predictive Modeling:
Develop regression models to predict binding capacity, selectivity, and purification efficiency based on resin properties and process parameters.
Evaluate model performance using cross-validation and other techniques.

**Both**

6. Optimization:
Use optimization algorithms to identify optimal resin formulations and process conditions that maximize resin performance.
Conduct confirmation experiments to validate optimized conditions and assess robustness.

## Expected Outcomes:

Identification of key factors influencing chromatography resin performance for mAb purification.
Development of predictive models to guide resin design and optimization efforts.
Optimization of resin formulations and process parameters to achieve maximum binding capacity, selectivity, and purification efficiency.
